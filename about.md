### About Gavin Rozzi
<p>
Gavin Rozzi is an independent journalist who has created several successful local news websites and investigative journalism platforms serving New Jersey. His political news website Ocean County Politics has been known for uncovering details about investigations of political leaders in Ocean County, NJ. Rozzi’s second web project, JerseyLeaks, a whistleblowing platform operated in collaboration with other journalists, uses encryption to provide anonymity to sources seeking to blow the whistle on matters of public corruption. His latest website, OPRAmachine, is a statewide freedom of information portal that allows anybody to easily request public documents from state and local governmental agencies under the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA). The site is saving taxpayer resources while substantially increasing government transparency by making the site’s entire archive of public documents freely available online.
